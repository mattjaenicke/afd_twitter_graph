## AfD Twitter Netzwerk Graph

This projects tries to explore the social media relationships of the German right-wing populist party "Alternative für Deutschland" (AfD).
Based on https://github.com/edent/Twitter-Networks.  


1. Starting from the seed account "AfD_Bund" collect followers.
2. Process the collected twitter data to generate an output file of relationships between twitter accounts.
3. The network data can then be visualized in the tool of your choice. I used "Gephi" (visualization not part of this repo).
